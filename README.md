# Customer Segmentation of Transaction Data

This repository contains a project on **Customer Segmentation** using transaction data to enable data-driven marketing strategies. This project involves applying clustering techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behaviors. These segments allow companies to better target specific customer groups, optimize marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and increase retention.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation allows companies to categorize customers into different groups based on similarities in purchasing behavior. By leveraging these segments, companies can tailor their strategies to improve customer satisfaction, engagement, and loyalty, while maximizing revenue from targeted promotions and product offerings.

## Business Problem

In today's competitive business environment, it is crucial to understand customers' preferences and behaviors. This project addresses the following challenges:
1. **Identify key customer segments** based on purchasing patterns and transaction characteristics.
2. **Enhance personalized marketing** by catering to the specific needs and preferences of each customer segment.
3. **Optimize resource allocation** by targeting segments with tailored offers and campaigns.

## Dataset Overview

The transaction dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Transaction Amount**: Value of each transaction, indicating purchasing power or spending behavior.
- **Transaction Date**: Date on which each transaction was made.
- **Location**: (Optional) Geographic data related to where the transaction was made, useful for geo-based segmentation.
- **Other Features**: Any other relevant features capturing customer demographics or transactional details.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

1. Group customers into meaningful segments based on their transaction history.
2. Identify the distinguishing characteristics of each segment to provide actionable business insights.
3. Evaluate the clustering models and select the best one based on objective criteria.

## Methodology and Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Address missing data to ensure model robustness.
   - **Outlier Detection and Removal**: Identify and manage outliers in the transaction data.
   - **Data Transformation**: Normalize or standardize transaction amounts and other continuous features.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Recency**: Days since the last transaction.
   - **Frequency**: Total number of transactions by each customer.
   - **Monetary**: Total spending by each customer.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**: Apply clustering techniques such as:
   - **K-Means Clustering**: To form customer clusters based on proximity.
   - **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering to identify core customer clusters.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: For creating a hierarchy of segments.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process involves analyzing data distributions, relationships, and trends to better understand customer behaviors. Key analysis steps include:

- **Distribution Analysis**: Understand the range and distribution of transaction amounts and frequencies.
- **Correlations**: Evaluate correlations between different features.
- **Visualization**: Graphically represent transaction patterns, such as spending trends over time, purchase frequency, and geographic distribution.

## Clustering Models

Each clustering technique used in this project has its own advantages. Here’s a brief overview:

- **K-Means**: A centroid-based approach that divides the dataset into k clusters.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-Based Spatial Clustering, useful for discovering clusters with varying shapes.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Constructs a multi-level hierarchy of clusters using agglomerative or divisive techniques.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the clustering models is crucial to selecting the best segmentation. Metrics used include:

- **Silhouette Score**: Measures the compactness of clusters.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: Reflects the average ratio of within-cluster distances to inter-cluster distances.
- **Elbow Method**: Used with K-Means to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Insights and Segment Characteristics

Once clusters are identified, each segment's unique characteristics are analyzed. Example segments might include:

1. **High-Value Customers**: High transaction frequency and value.
2. **Occasional Buyers**: Low transaction frequency but consistent spending.
3. **Bargain Shoppers**: Low transaction value but high frequency.
   
By analyzing each segment, we provide actionable insights for targeted marketing, personalized campaigns, and customer engagement strategies.
